This is my fake news detection repository..
# 📰 Fake News Detection Project

This repository contains a machine learning project that detects whether a news article is **real** or **fake** using Natural Language Processing and supervised learning models.

## 📁 Files in this Repo

- `Fake_news_detection.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with full preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Fake.csv` — Dataset with fake news articles.
- `True.csv` — Dataset with real news articles.
- `manual_testing.csv` — Custom samples for manual testing.
- `I-Newspaper2.jpg` — Optional image for presentation or UI.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.

## 🔍 Techniques Used

- Data Preprocessing (text cleaning, stopwords, stemming)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, PassiveAggressiveClassifier
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
- Manual Testing via custom CSV inputs

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

You can run the notebook on:
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) *(Recommended)*
- Jupyter Notebook (locally)

## 📊 Example Output

- Accuracy: ~93% on test data
- Manual prediction on headlines: returns **FAKE** or **REAL**
